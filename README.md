# Pneumonia-Detection
This project is a machine learning model for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze the images and predict whether the patient has pneumonia or not. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle.
