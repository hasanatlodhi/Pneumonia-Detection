# Pneumonia-Detection
This project is a machine learning model for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze the images and predict whether the patient has pneumonia or not. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle.

The model is implemented in Python using the Keras deep learning library, and trained using the TensorFlow backend. The project also includes a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the data preparation, model training, and evaluation process.

The main goal of this project is to assist doctors and healthcare professionals in making accurate and efficient diagnoses of pneumonia, which can lead to better outcomes for patients. The model has the potential to be integrated with mobile or web-based platforms for remote diagnosis and improved access to healthcare.
